===============================Version Beta-0.1=============================== 
- oi.api and oi.templates.user : new GUI

- oi.templates.user (concerts, pieces and instruments) : are now composed (mainly) by abstractions, so moving your projects to newer OI versions becomes easier; 

- oi.piece.mixer : new abstraction to automatically create a mixer containing channelstrips for each instrument in your piece; 

- o.lib : has been moved to another repository (https://github.com/p1nh0/plib), this will keep the OI repository smaller and easier to manage ????????
