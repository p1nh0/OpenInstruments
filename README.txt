\f0\b\fs42 \cf0 Open Instruments (alpha 0.5_031012\'97 "hello world") 
\fs24 \
\
Introduction \

\b0 Open Instruments is a MaxMSP framework for the development and performance of digital musical instruments. \
It is part of my personal Master's project, that I would like to share with you. Don't hesitate to contact me at if you have any question. \
I'm currently fixing some bugs, improving documentation (for the plane user first, and then for interested developers) and making examples. So please be patient.

\
Installing OI framework\

\b0 \
1 \'97 MOVE "_OI clippings" \'97> "\'85/Applications/Max/patches/clippings"\
	to access clippings restart Max (if it was open when you moved this folder) and \
		click with the right button on an empty area of your patch, then, in the menu, go to "paste from"\
			\'85you should see "_OI clippings"\'85 \
 \
2 \'97 MOVE "_OI extras" \'97> "\'85/Applications/Max/patches/extras"\
		to launch oi.api, open Max, go to the 'extras' menu and to "_OI extras", where oi.api is located\
	\
3 \'97 MOVE "_OI templates" \'97> "\'85/Applications/Max/patches/templates"\
		to access them, open Max, go to the 'File' menu, and then click 'New from template' \
\
4 \'97 Finally MOVE "OI lib" somewhere where Max can see it \
		option a) \'97> "\'85/Applications/Max/patches/" \
		option b)  move it to where ever you want, then go to Max > Options menu > File Preferences \
					and add "OI lib" path (don't forget to check subfolders)\
	(you can leave "OI examples" outside max's search path\'85if you want to)\
\
5 \'97 Ignore the folder 'developer resources' if you're just planning to use Open Instruments. \
	If you want to help developing OI framework then this folder should bare useful resources\'85 \
\
