This folder is a safe staging area. It contains two subfolders : "deprecated" and "under_development". In the "deprecated" folder you should place deprecated files, and wait until you're positively shure that they are really deprecated. Whereas in the "new" folder you can add new abstractions until they are complete and ready to use with OI. 

PS: it has nothing to do wiht git's staging area
